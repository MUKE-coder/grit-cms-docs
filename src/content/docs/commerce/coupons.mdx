## Overview

Coupons let you offer discounts to your customers during checkout. You can create percentage-based or fixed-amount discounts, restrict them to specific products, set usage limits, and define validity windows. Manage all your coupons from **Commerce > Coupons** in the admin sidebar.

## Creating a Coupon

1. Navigate to **Commerce > Coupons** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click **New Coupon**.
3. Fill in the coupon settings and save.

### Coupon Settings

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Code** | The coupon code customers will enter at checkout (e.g., `SUMMER20`). Codes are automatically converted to uppercase. |
| **Type** | The discount type: `percentage` or `fixed`. |
| **Amount** | The discount value. For percentage coupons, this is the percent off (e.g., `20` for 20% off). For fixed coupons, this is the dollar amount deducted. |
| **Min Order Amount** | The minimum order subtotal required for the coupon to apply. Set to `0` for no minimum. |
| **Max Uses** | The maximum number of times this coupon can be redeemed across all customers. Set to `0` for unlimited use. |
| **Valid From** | The date and time when the coupon becomes active. Leave empty if the coupon should be valid immediately. |
| **Valid Until** | The expiration date and time. After this date, the coupon can no longer be used. Leave empty for no expiration. |
| **Product IDs** | Restrict the coupon to specific products. If set, the coupon only applies to orders containing those products. Leave empty to apply to any product. |
| **Status** | The coupon status: `active`, `expired`, or `disabled`. Only active coupons can be redeemed. |

## Coupon Types

### Percentage Discount

A percentage coupon reduces the order subtotal by a given percentage. For example, a coupon with an amount of `25` takes 25% off the order subtotal.

If the calculated discount exceeds the order subtotal (which can happen with stacking or rounding), the discount is capped at the subtotal so the total never goes below zero.

### Fixed Amount Discount

A fixed coupon deducts a specific dollar amount from the order subtotal. For example, a coupon with an amount of `10` takes $10.00 off the order. Like percentage coupons, the discount is capped at the subtotal to prevent negative totals.

## Coupon Validation

When a customer enters a coupon code at checkout, GritCMS runs the following validation checks in order:

1. **Code exists** -- The code must match an existing coupon in the system.
2. **Status is active** -- Only coupons with an `active` status are accepted.
3. **Within validity window** -- If `valid_from` is set, the current time must be after that date. If `valid_until` is set, the current time must be before that date.
4. **Usage limit not reached** -- If `max_uses` is greater than zero, the coupon's `used_count` must be less than `max_uses`.
5. **Minimum order met** -- The order subtotal must be at least the `min_order_amount`.

If any check fails, the coupon is rejected with a descriptive error message.

### Public Validation Endpoint

GritCMS provides a public API endpoint for validating coupons before the customer completes checkout. This allows your frontend to give the customer immediate feedback when they enter a coupon code.

Send a `GET` request to the coupon validation endpoint with the `code` query parameter. If the coupon is valid, the endpoint returns the coupon details (type, amount, restrictions). If invalid, it returns an error message explaining why.

This endpoint checks the code, status, validity dates, and usage limits, but does not check the order subtotal since the order has not been placed yet.

## Applying Coupons at Checkout

Coupons are applied during the checkout flow on your public site. When a customer is purchasing a product at `yoursite.com/products/{slug}`, they can enter a coupon code before completing payment. The code is validated via the API in real time, and the discount is reflected in the order total before the customer confirms. There is no dedicated public page for coupons -- they are validated entirely through the checkout process.

When an order is created with a coupon code, the following happens:

1. The coupon is looked up and validated against all checks.
2. The discount is calculated based on the coupon type and amount.
3. The discount amount is subtracted from the order subtotal to produce the final total.
4. The coupon's **Used Count** is incremented by one.
5. The coupon is linked to the order so you can see which coupon was applied when viewing order details.

## Managing Coupons

The coupon list shows all your coupons with their code, type, discount amount, usage count, and status. From this list you can:

- **Edit** a coupon to change its settings, validity dates, or usage limits.
- **Disable** a coupon by setting its status to `disabled`. Disabled coupons cannot be redeemed but are kept for your records.
- **Delete** a coupon you no longer need.

### Tracking Coupon Usage

Each coupon tracks how many times it has been used. The **Used Count** increments automatically every time the coupon is applied to an order. Compare this against the **Max Uses** limit to see how many redemptions remain.

### Tips for Effective Coupon Campaigns

- Use memorable, descriptive codes like `WELCOME10` or `BLACKFRIDAY` so customers can easily remember and share them.
- Set a **Valid Until** date to create urgency and encourage customers to use the discount before it expires.
- Use **Min Order Amount** to ensure coupons are only applied to orders above a certain value, protecting your margins.
- Restrict coupons to specific products when running promotions on individual items rather than your entire catalog.
- Monitor the **Used Count** regularly to understand how well your promotions are performing.
