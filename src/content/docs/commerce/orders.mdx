## Overview

Every time a customer completes a purchase, an order is created in GritCMS. The order management dashboard gives you a centralized view of all transactions, including the customer details, items purchased, totals, payment information, and current status. You can find orders under **Commerce > Orders** in the admin sidebar.

## Order Dashboard

The orders list displays all orders sorted by date, with the most recent orders shown first. Each row shows the order number, customer name, status, total amount, and date.

### Filtering and Searching

You can narrow down the orders list using the available filters:

- **Status** -- Filter by a specific order status such as pending, paid, or refunded.
- **Contact** -- View all orders from a particular customer by filtering on their contact ID.

Orders are paginated, so you can browse through your order history page by page.

## Order Statuses

Every order moves through one or more of the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | The order has been created but payment has not been completed yet. This is the default status for new orders. |
| **Paid** | Payment has been received and confirmed. The order is fulfilled -- for course products, the customer is automatically enrolled. |
| **Failed** | The payment attempt was unsuccessful. The customer may need to retry. |
| **Refunded** | The full order amount has been returned to the customer. |
| **Partially Refunded** | A portion of the order amount has been refunded. |

### Updating Order Status

To change an order's status:

1. Open the order by clicking on its order number in the list.
2. Select the new status from the status options.
3. Save the change.

When you mark an order as **Paid**, several things happen automatically:

- The **Paid At** timestamp is recorded.
- If the order contains course products, the customer is automatically enrolled in the linked courses.
- A **purchase completed** event is emitted, which can trigger workflow automations (e.g., sending a confirmation email).

When you mark an order as **Refunded**, a **purchase refunded** event is emitted for automation triggers.

## Order Details

Click on any order to view its full details. The order detail view includes:

### Customer Information

The contact associated with the order is displayed at the top, showing their name and email. You can click through to the contact's profile for more details.

### Order Items

A table of all items in the order, showing:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Product** | The name of the product purchased. |
| **Variant** | The selected variant, if applicable. |
| **Unit Price** | The price per unit at the time of purchase. |
| **Quantity** | How many units were ordered. |
| **Total** | The line item total (unit price multiplied by quantity). |

### Financial Summary

- **Subtotal** -- The sum of all line item totals before discounts.
- **Discount** -- The amount deducted if a coupon was applied. The coupon details are shown alongside.
- **Tax** -- Any tax amount applied to the order.
- **Total** -- The final amount charged to the customer.

### Payment Details

If the order was processed through a payment provider, you will see the payment provider name and the external payment ID. This is useful for cross-referencing transactions in your payment provider's dashboard.

## Processing Refunds

To refund a paid order:

1. Open the order from the orders list.
2. Click the **Refund** button.
3. Confirm the refund.

Refunds can only be processed on orders that are currently in the **Paid** status. Once refunded, the order status changes to **Refunded** and a refund event is emitted for any connected automations.

If you need to issue a partial refund, update the order status to **Partially Refunded** and handle the actual refund through your payment provider's dashboard.

## Order Notifications and Automations

GritCMS emits events at key points in the order lifecycle. You can use these events in the **Automation > Workflows** module to trigger actions:

- **Purchase Completed** -- Fires when an order moves to the Paid status. Use this to send order confirmation emails, grant access to content, or update CRM tags.
- **Purchase Refunded** -- Fires when an order is refunded. Use this to send refund confirmation emails or revoke access.

## Viewing Order History

To see all orders for a specific customer:

1. Navigate to **Contacts** and open the customer's profile.
2. The activity timeline will show their purchase history.
3. Alternatively, use the **contact_id** filter on the orders list to see all orders from that contact.

### Revenue Dashboard

For a high-level overview of your sales performance, visit the **Commerce > Dashboard** section. The revenue dashboard shows:

- **Total Revenue** -- Sum of all paid orders.
- **Monthly Revenue** -- Revenue for the current month.
- **Total Orders** -- Count of all paid orders.
- **Active Subscriptions** -- Number of currently active subscriptions.
- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)** -- Calculated from all active subscription prices.
- **Recent Orders** -- The five most recent paid orders.
