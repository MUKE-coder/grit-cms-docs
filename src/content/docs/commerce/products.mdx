## Overview

Products are at the heart of your commerce module. Whether you sell digital downloads, physical goods, online courses, memberships, or services, every item you offer is managed from the **Commerce > Products** section in your admin dashboard. Each product can have multiple price tiers, variants, and images, giving you the flexibility to sell however you need to.

## Creating a Product

1. Navigate to **Commerce > Products** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click the **New Product** button.
3. Fill in the product details and save.

### Product Fields

Every product has the following core fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The display name of your product, shown to customers on the storefront. |
| **Slug** | A URL-friendly identifier auto-generated from the name (e.g., `premium-ebook`). You can edit it manually. |
| **Description** | A rich text description of the product. Use this to explain what the customer will receive. |
| **Type** | The kind of product: `digital`, `physical`, `course`, `membership`, or `service`. |
| **Status** | Controls visibility: `active` (listed publicly), `inactive` (hidden), or `archived` (removed from listings). |
| **Images** | One or more product images. The first image is used as the featured image on the storefront. |
| **Downloadable Files** | For digital products, attach the files that customers will receive after purchase. |

### Product Types

Choose a type that matches what you are selling:

- **Digital** -- Downloadable files such as ebooks, templates, or software.
- **Physical** -- Tangible goods that require shipping.
- **Course** -- Links to a course in the Courses module. When a customer purchases a course product, they are automatically enrolled.
- **Membership** -- Recurring access to gated content or community spaces.
- **Service** -- One-time or ongoing services you provide.

## Product Variants

Variants let you offer different options for a single product, such as size, color, or format. Each variant can have its own SKU, stock quantity, and an optional price override.

### Adding Variants

1. Open the product you want to edit.
2. Scroll to the **Variants** section and click **Add Variant**.
3. Provide a name (e.g., "Large / Blue"), an optional SKU, and any attributes.
4. If this variant has a different price, set a **Price Override**. Otherwise it uses the product's default pricing.
5. For physical products, set the **Stock Quantity** to track inventory.

| Variant Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | A descriptive label for the variant, such as "Small" or "PDF Format". |
| **SKU** | An optional stock-keeping unit code for inventory management. |
| **Price Override** | If set, this price is used instead of the product's default price. |
| **Stock Quantity** | The number of units available. Leave empty for unlimited stock. |
| **Attributes** | Custom key-value pairs for additional variant details (e.g., color, weight). |

## Pricing

Each product can have one or more price tiers. This allows you to offer both one-time purchases and recurring subscriptions for the same product, or to provide multiple pricing options at different amounts.

### One-Time Pricing

A one-time price charges the customer a single amount at checkout. This is the default pricing type and is suitable for digital downloads, physical goods, and standalone services.

### Recurring Pricing (Subscriptions)

A recurring price charges the customer on an ongoing basis -- either monthly or yearly. Use this for memberships, ongoing services, or any product that requires a subscription.

When creating a recurring price, you can also set a **Trial Period** (in days). During the trial, the customer has access to the product before their first payment is collected.

### Adding a Price Tier

1. Open the product and scroll to the **Pricing** section.
2. Click **Add Price**.
3. Set the **Amount** and **Currency** (defaults to USD).
4. Choose the **Type**: one-time or subscription.
5. For subscriptions, select the **Interval** (month or year) and optionally set **Trial Days**.
6. Use **Sort Order** to control which price appears first on the storefront.

You can add multiple price tiers to give customers options. For example, a membership product might offer a $9/month tier and a $89/year tier.

## Product Listing on the Public Site

Only products with an **active** status appear on your public storefront. Visitors can browse your product catalog, view individual product pages by slug, and see all available prices and variants.

The public storefront supports pagination, so customers can browse through your catalog even if you have a large number of products. Products are displayed in reverse chronological order by default, with the newest products shown first.

### Public Product Page

Each active product has a public page accessible at its slug URL. The product page displays the product name, description, images, all available price tiers, and any variants. Customers can select a variant and price tier before proceeding to checkout.

## Managing Products

The **Commerce > Products** list shows all of your products with their name, type, status, pricing, and sales count. From this list you can:

- **Search** products by name using the search bar.
- **Filter** by status (active, inactive, archived) or by type (digital, physical, course, membership, service).
- **Edit** a product by clicking on its name.
- **Delete** a product you no longer sell.

### Tips for Product Management

- Start with an **inactive** status while you are setting up the product, then switch to **active** when it is ready.
- Use clear, descriptive names and thorough descriptions to help customers understand what they are purchasing.
- Add multiple images so customers can see the product from different angles or preview digital content.
- For course products, link the product to the appropriate course so that enrollment happens automatically after purchase.
