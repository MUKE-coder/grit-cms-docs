## Overview

GritCMS ships with over 300 pre-designed website sections that you can use in the page builder. Every section is fully responsive, styled with Tailwind CSS, and customizable through the section editor. Sections are organized into 20 categories covering every part of a website.

All sections use a clean, neutral color palette by default (gray-900, gray-600, white, with indigo-600 accents) so they work well together regardless of which sections you combine.

## How Sections Work

Each section is a self-contained React component with:

- **Default content** -- Realistic placeholder text and layout so you can see what the section looks like immediately.
- **Editable props** -- Every piece of text, image, color, and setting can be customized through the section editor.
- **Responsive design** -- Sections adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes automatically.
- **No external dependencies** -- Sections use only Tailwind CSS classes, with no component library required.

When you add a section to a page, a copy is created with the default content. You then customize the content to match your needs. Changes to one page's section do not affect the same section used on other pages.
