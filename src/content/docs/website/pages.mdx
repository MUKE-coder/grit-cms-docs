## Overview

Pages are the building blocks of your website. Unlike blog posts, pages are standalone pieces of content that typically don't change often -- think About, Contact, Terms of Service, or Landing pages. You can create as many pages as you need from the **Website > Pages** section in your admin dashboard.

## Creating a New Page

1. Navigate to **Website > Pages** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click the **New Page** button in the top-right corner.
3. You will be taken to the page editor where you can write your content and configure page settings.

### Writing Content with the Rich Text Editor

The page editor includes a full-featured rich text editor with a formatting toolbar. You can use the toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts to format your content:

| Format | Toolbar Button | Keyboard Shortcut |
|---|---|---|
| Bold | **B** | `Ctrl + B` |
| Italic | *I* | `Ctrl + I` |
| Heading 1 | H1 | -- |
| Heading 2 | H2 | -- |
| Heading 3 | H3 | -- |
| Bulleted List | List icon | -- |
| Numbered List | Numbered list icon | -- |
| Link | Link icon | `Ctrl + K` |
| Image | Image icon | -- |
| Code Block | Code icon | -- |

To insert an image, click the image button in the toolbar and provide the image URL. The image will be displayed inline within your content.

To insert a link, highlight the text you want to link, then click the link button or press `Ctrl + K` and enter the destination URL.

### Custom HTML Content

For advanced layouts, you can switch to the HTML editing mode. This lets you write raw HTML directly, giving you full control over the page structure. This is useful when you need to embed third-party widgets, add custom CSS classes, or create layouts that go beyond what the rich text editor offers.

## Page Settings

Every page has a settings panel where you configure how it appears on your site.

### Title

The page title is displayed at the top of the page and in the browser tab. Choose a clear, descriptive title that tells visitors what the page is about.

### Slug

The slug is the URL-friendly version of your title. For example, a page titled "About Us" would have the slug `about-us`, making the full URL `yoursite.com/about-us`. The slug is auto-generated from the title, but you can edit it manually if you prefer a different URL.

### Status

Pages have two statuses:

- **Draft** -- The page is saved but not visible to the public. Use this while you are still working on the content.
- **Published** -- The page is live and accessible to anyone who visits your site.

### Featured Image

You can set a featured image for each page. This image may be used as a banner at the top of the page or as the preview image when the page is shared on social media, depending on your theme configuration.

## Page Preview and Publishing Workflow

A typical workflow for creating a page looks like this:

1. **Create** a new page and write your content using the editor.
2. **Save as Draft** to store your progress without making the page public.
3. **Preview** the page to see how it will look to visitors on the public site.
4. **Publish** the page when you are satisfied with the content.

You can return to any published page at any time to make edits. After saving your changes, the updated content is immediately live on your site.

## Managing Existing Pages

The **Website > Pages** list shows all of your pages with their title, slug, status, and last updated date. From this list you can:

- **Edit** a page by clicking on its title.
- **Delete** a page you no longer need.
- **Change status** between Draft and Published.

### Tips for Organizing Your Pages

- Use clear, descriptive titles so you can find pages quickly in the admin list.
- Keep slugs short and readable -- `/about` is better than `/about-our-company-and-team`.
- Start with Draft status and only publish when the content is ready for visitors.
- Review your pages periodically to make sure the information is still accurate.
