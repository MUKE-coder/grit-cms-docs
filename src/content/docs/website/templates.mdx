## Overview

GritCMS includes over 100 page templates that you can apply to any page with a single click. Each template is a complete page layout with pre-configured sections -- a header, hero, content sections, and footer already arranged and filled with realistic placeholder content. Apply a template, then customize the text, images, and colors to match your brand.

Templates are the fastest way to create a professional-looking page. Instead of picking and arranging individual sections, you get a complete page structure in seconds.

## How Templates Work

A template is a predefined list of sections with default content. When you apply a template to a page:

1. The template's sections are added to your page, replacing any existing sections.
2. Each section gets a copy of the template's default content.
3. You can then edit any section's content, reorder sections, add new sections, or remove sections you don't need.

Templates are a **starting point**, not a constraint. After applying a template, you have full control over every section on the page.

## Applying a Template

1. Navigate to the page editor (create a new page or open an existing one).
2. Click **Browse Templates** in the structure panel of the page builder.
3. The Template Gallery opens as a full-screen modal.
4. Browse templates by category using the tabs, or use the search to filter.
5. Click a template card to see a preview listing all its sections.
6. Click **Use Template** to apply it to your page.

You can also click **Start Blank** to dismiss the gallery and build your page from scratch.

**Note:** Applying a template replaces all existing sections on the page. If you have unsaved work, save your page before applying a template.
