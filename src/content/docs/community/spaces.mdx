## Overview

Spaces are the foundation of your community. Think of them as forums, channels, or groups where members gather around a shared topic or interest. Each space has its own threads, members, and settings. You can create as many spaces as you need from the **Community > Spaces** section in your admin dashboard.

## Creating a Space

1. Navigate to **Community > Spaces** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click the **New Space** button.
3. Fill in the space details and save.

### Space Settings

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The display name of the space (e.g., "General Discussion" or "Product Feedback"). |
| **Slug** | A URL-friendly identifier auto-generated from the name. You can customize it manually. |
| **Description** | A short summary of what this space is about. This helps members understand the purpose of the space before joining. |
| **Type** | Controls access: `public`, `private`, or `paid`. See the section below for details on each type. |
| **Icon** | An optional icon to visually distinguish the space in the sidebar and listings. |
| **Color** | A hex color code used as the accent color for the space. Defaults to `#6366f1`. |
| **Sort Order** | A number that determines the position of this space in the list. Lower numbers appear first. |

### Space Types

- **Public** -- Visible to everyone and open for any member to join. Public spaces appear on your public community page.
- **Private** -- Only visible to invited members. Private spaces do not appear in the public listing. Members must be added manually by an admin.
- **Paid** -- Requires a product purchase for access. When you select the paid type, you can link the space to a product from the Commerce module. Only customers who have purchased that product can access the space.

## Member Management

Every space has its own list of members. Members are contacts from your CRM who have been added to the space, either by joining a public space, being invited to a private space, or purchasing access to a paid space.

### Member Roles

Each member is assigned one of three roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Full control over the space: manage settings, moderate threads, manage members, and all member abilities. |
| **Moderator** | Can pin, close, and delete threads, remove replies, and manage members. Cannot change space settings. |
| **Member** | Can create threads, post replies, and react to content. This is the default role for new members. |

### Adding Members

1. Open the space and go to the **Members** tab.
2. Click **Add Member**.
3. Select a contact from your CRM and choose their role.
4. The member is added immediately and can start participating.

### Changing a Member's Role

1. Find the member in the space's member list.
2. Click the role badge or edit button next to their name.
3. Select the new role from the dropdown.

### Removing Members

To remove a member from a space, click the remove button next to their name in the members list. This revokes their access to the space and all its content. If the space is public, the member can rejoin at any time.

## Reordering Spaces

You can change the order in which spaces appear in the community sidebar and listings:

1. Go to **Community > Spaces**.
2. Drag and drop spaces into your preferred order, or update the **Sort Order** field on each space.
3. Spaces with a lower sort order number appear higher in the list.

## Space Listing on the Public Site

Public spaces are automatically listed on your community page on the public website. Each space in the listing shows:

- The space name and description.
- The member count -- how many contacts are currently in the space.
- The thread count -- how many discussion threads exist in the space.

Visitors can click on a public space to browse its threads. Private and paid spaces are not shown in the public listing.

## Managing Spaces

The **Community > Spaces** list in the admin dashboard shows all your spaces with their name, type, member count, and thread count. From this list you can:

- **Edit** a space by clicking on its name to update settings, description, or type.
- **View Members** to manage the people in the space.
- **View Threads** to see and moderate the discussions happening in the space.
- **Delete** a space to permanently remove it and all its threads, replies, and member associations.

### Tips for Organizing Your Community

- Create a **General** or **Welcome** space as a starting point for new members to introduce themselves.
- Use **Private** spaces for exclusive groups like beta testers, VIP customers, or team members.
- Link **Paid** spaces to premium products to monetize your community and offer exclusive discussions.
- Write clear descriptions so members know what kind of content belongs in each space.
- Keep the number of spaces manageable -- too many spaces can fragment conversations and make the community feel empty.
