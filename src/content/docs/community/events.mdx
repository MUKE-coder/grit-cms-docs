## Overview

Community events bring your members together around a shared experience, whether it is a live webinar, a workshop, a meetup, or an in-person gathering. You can create events tied to specific spaces, manage RSVPs, track attendees, and update event statuses as they progress. Events are managed from the **Community > Events** section in the admin dashboard.

:::note
Community events are managed entirely from the admin dashboard. Members see events listed within the space they belong to on the public site. There is no separate public events listing page -- events are accessed through their associated space.

## Creating an Event

1. Navigate to **Community > Events** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click **New Event**.
3. Fill in the event details and save.

### Event Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | The name of the event displayed to members. |
| **Description** | A detailed description of the event, including what attendees can expect, the agenda, or any preparation required. |
| **Space** | The community space this event belongs to. Events are always associated with a space. |
| **Type** | Whether the event is `virtual` (online) or `in_person` (physical location). |
| **Location** | The physical address for in-person events. |
| **URL** | The meeting link or streaming URL for virtual events (e.g., a Zoom or Google Meet link). |
| **Start At** | The date and time when the event begins. |
| **End At** | The date and time when the event ends. |
| **Max Attendees** | The maximum number of people who can register. Set to `0` for unlimited capacity. |
| **Status** | The current state of the event: `upcoming`, `live`, `completed`, or `cancelled`. |

### Event Types

- **Virtual** -- Online events such as webinars, live streams, or virtual workshops. Provide a **URL** so attendees know where to join.
- **In Person** -- Physical events such as meetups, conferences, or workshops. Provide a **Location** with the venue address.

## Event Statuses

Events progress through the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Upcoming** | The event has been created and is scheduled for a future date. This is the default status. Members can register to attend. |
| **Live** | The event is currently happening. Update to this status when the event begins. |
| **Completed** | The event has ended. No new registrations are accepted. |
| **Cancelled** | The event has been called off. Registered attendees should be notified. |

Update the event status manually as the event progresses from upcoming to live to completed.

## Attendee Management

### Registering Attendees (RSVP)

Members can register for an event by RSVPing. Each registration creates an attendee record linked to the event and the member's contact profile.

To register an attendee from the admin dashboard:

1. Open the event.
2. Click **Add Attendee** or **Register**.
3. Select the contact from your CRM.
4. The attendee is added with a status of **Registered**.

If a maximum attendee limit is set on the event, the system enforces the cap. Once the limit is reached, no additional registrations can be accepted.

### Attendee Statuses

Each attendee has one of the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Registered** | The attendee has RSVPd and is confirmed. |
| **Attended** | The attendee was present at the event. Update this status after the event concludes. |
| **Cancelled** | The attendee cancelled their registration. |

### Cancelling a Registration

To cancel an attendee's registration:

1. Open the event and go to the attendees list.
2. Find the attendee and click **Cancel Registration**.
3. Their status changes to **Cancelled**, freeing up a spot if the event has a maximum attendee limit.

## Viewing Events

### Admin View

The **Community > Events** admin list shows all events with their title, space, date, status, and attendee count. You can filter events by:

- **Space** -- Show only events belonging to a particular space.
- **Status** -- Filter by upcoming, live, completed, or cancelled events.

Events are sorted by start date in ascending order, so the soonest events appear at the top.

### Event Detail View

Click on an event to see its full details, including the description, timing, location or URL, and a complete list of registered attendees with their contact information and registration status.

## Managing Events

From the events list you can:

- **Edit** an event to update its title, description, dates, location, or capacity.
- **Update Status** to reflect the event's current state (upcoming, live, completed, cancelled).
- **View Attendees** to see who has registered and manage their statuses.
- **Delete** an event to permanently remove it from the system.

### Tips for Running Successful Community Events

- Create events well in advance and share them in the associated space so members have time to plan.
- For virtual events, include the meeting URL in the event details so attendees can join easily when the time comes.
- Set a **Max Attendees** limit for smaller, more intimate events like workshops to ensure quality interaction.
- Update the event status to **Live** when it starts and **Completed** when it ends to keep your event history accurate.
- After an event, update attendee statuses to **Attended** for those who were present. This data helps you understand engagement levels.
- Consider creating a dedicated space for event-related discussions so attendees can connect before and after the event.
