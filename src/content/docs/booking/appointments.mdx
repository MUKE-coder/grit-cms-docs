## Overview

Appointments are the core records of the booking system. When a visitor selects a time slot on a public booking page and submits their details, GritCMS creates an appointment. You manage all appointments from the **Booking > Appointments** section in the admin dashboard, where you can view upcoming sessions, cancel or reschedule bookings, and mark appointments as completed.

## How Clients Book Appointments

The booking flow from the visitor's perspective works as follows:

1. The visitor opens the public booking page for an event type at `/api/book/{event-type-slug}`.
2. They select a date and the system returns available time slots based on the calendar's availability, existing bookings, and buffer times.
3. The visitor picks a slot and submits their name, email, and optional notes.
4. GritCMS creates the appointment with a **confirmed** status and returns the booking details.

If the visitor's email address is not already in your contacts, GritCMS automatically creates a new contact record with the source set to `booking`. If the email already exists, the appointment is linked to the existing contact.

## Appointment Statuses

Every appointment has a status that reflects where it is in its lifecycle:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Confirmed** | The default status when an appointment is booked. The session is scheduled and expected to happen. |
| **Rescheduled** | The appointment was moved to a different time. The new start and end times are updated on the record. |
| **Cancelled** | The appointment was cancelled by the admin. The time slot becomes available for other bookings. |
| **Completed** | The session has taken place. Mark appointments as completed after they occur to keep your records accurate. |

Appointments start as **confirmed** and move through the lifecycle based on admin actions.

## Managing Appointments in Admin

The **Booking > Appointments** list shows all appointments with their event type, contact, scheduled time, and status. You can filter the list by:

- **Status** -- Show only confirmed, cancelled, or completed appointments.
- **Event Type** -- Filter by a specific event type to see only those bookings.
- **Upcoming** -- Show only appointments scheduled in the future.

### Viewing Appointment Details

Click on an appointment to see the full details including:

- The event type name, duration, and calendar.
- The contact's name and email.
- The scheduled start and end times.
- Any notes the visitor provided during booking.
- The meeting URL, if one has been set.

### Cancelling an Appointment

To cancel an appointment:

1. Open the appointment from the list.
2. Click **Cancel Appointment**.
3. The status changes to **cancelled**.

When an appointment is cancelled, GritCMS emits a `booking.cancelled` event. You can use this event in workflow automations to send a cancellation notification email to the client.

The cancelled appointment's time slot becomes available again for new bookings.

### Rescheduling an Appointment

To reschedule an appointment to a different time:

1. Open the appointment from the list.
2. Click **Reschedule**.
3. Provide the new start time in ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 format (e.g., `2025-03-15T14:00:00Z`).
4. GritCMS automatically calculates the new end time based on the event type's duration and sets the status back to **confirmed**.

A `booking.rescheduled` event is emitted, which you can use to notify the client about the time change.

### Completing an Appointment

After a session has taken place:

1. Open the appointment from the list.
2. Click **Complete**.
3. The status changes to **completed**.

Marking appointments as completed helps you track which sessions have occurred and keeps your appointment list clean.

## Booking Confirmation Emails

When a visitor books an appointment, GritCMS emits a `booking.confirmed` event containing the appointment ID, contact ID, and event type name. You can set up a workflow automation to listen for this event and send a confirmation email to the client.

A typical confirmation email includes:

- The session name and description.
- The date and time of the appointment.
- A meeting URL or location details.
- Instructions for how to cancel or reschedule.

See the [Workflow Automation](/automation/workflows) documentation for how to create email automations triggered by booking events.

## Appointment Reminders

GritCMS does not send appointment reminders by default, but you can set them up using workflow automations. Create a workflow that triggers on the `booking.confirmed` event and schedules a delayed email to be sent a set amount of time before the appointment (for example, 24 hours or 1 hour before the session). This gives clients a timely reminder without requiring manual follow-up.

## Appointment Data

Each appointment record contains the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Event Type ID** | The event type this appointment belongs to. |
| **Contact ID** | The contact who booked the appointment. |
| **Start At** | The scheduled start time. |
| **End At** | The scheduled end time. |
| **Status** | One of `confirmed`, `rescheduled`, `cancelled`, or `completed`. |
| **Notes** | Free-text notes provided by the visitor during booking. |
| **Meeting URL** | An optional URL for a video call or meeting room. |

## Next Steps

With calendars, event types, and appointments configured, your booking system is fully operational. Visitors can self-serve their bookings, and you can manage everything from the admin dashboard. Combine booking events with [Workflow Automation](/automation/workflows) to create a hands-off scheduling experience with automatic confirmations and reminders.
