The Integrations tab in Settings lets you connect third-party services to enhance your GritCMS features. Currently, integrations focus on the **Booking** module -- connecting calendar and video meeting providers so appointments are synced and meeting links are generated automatically.

## Google Calendar

Connect your Google account to sync bookings to Google Calendar. When a visitor books an appointment, it automatically appears on your Google Calendar.

### Connecting Google Calendar

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations**.
2. In the **Google Calendar** section, click **Connect**.
3. A popup opens where you sign in to your Google account and grant GritCMS permission to manage calendar events.
4. Once authorized, the status changes to **Connected** and your bookings will sync automatically.

### Disconnecting

Click **Disconnect** at any time to revoke the connection. Existing calendar events are not removed, but new bookings will no longer create Google Calendar events.

### Requirements

Google Calendar integration requires OAuth2 credentials configured in your environment:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

See the [Environment Variables](/docs/configuration/environment) reference for setup details.

## Meeting Provider

Choose how meeting links are generated when someone books an appointment. The meeting provider setting determines what happens when a new appointment is confirmed.

### Options

| Provider | Description |
|---|---|
| **None** | No meeting link is generated. Use this for in-person meetings or when you prefer to send links manually. |
| **Google Meet** | A Google Meet link is automatically created and included in the appointment confirmation. Requires a connected Google Calendar. |
| **Zoom** | A Zoom meeting is automatically created and the join link is included in the appointment confirmation. Requires Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth credentials. |

Select your preferred provider from the radio options and click **Save Changes**.

## Zoom

Configure Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth credentials to auto-create Zoom meetings when appointments are booked.

### Setup Steps

1. Go to the [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create) and create a **Server-to-Server OAuth** app.
2. Copy the **Account ID**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** from your Zoom app.
3. In GritCMS, navigate to **Settings > Integrations**.
4. Enter the credentials in the **Zoom** section:
   - **Account ID** -- your Zoom Account ID
   - **Client ID** -- the S2S OAuth Client ID
   - **Client Secret** -- the S2S OAuth Client Secret
5. Click **Save Changes**.

The connection status badge shows **Connected** or **Not Connected** based on whether valid credentials are configured.

### Environment Variable Override

Zoom credentials can also be set via environment variables. If set, they take precedence over the values entered in the Settings UI:

```env
ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=your-zoom-account-id
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your-zoom-client-id
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your-zoom-client-secret
```

This is useful for keeping credentials out of the database in security-sensitive deployments.

## How Integrations Work with Booking

When a visitor books an appointment on your public site:

1. The appointment is created in the GritCMS database.
2. If **Google Calendar** is connected, a calendar event is created with the appointment details (time, attendee name, email).
3. If a **meeting provider** is configured:
   - **Google Meet**: A Meet link is generated and attached to both the calendar event and the appointment record.
   - **Zoom**: A Zoom meeting is created via the API and the join URL is saved to the appointment.
4. The meeting link is included in the confirmation email sent to the attendee.
