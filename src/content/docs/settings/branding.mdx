The Branding tab in Settings lets you define the visual identity of your public site. You can select a brand font, choose a brand color, and see a live preview of your changes before saving.

## Brand Font

GritCMS ships with **23 popular Google Fonts** built in, with **Onest** as the default. You can select any of these fonts from a dropdown, and the public site will load it automatically.

### Built-in Fonts

The built-in font list includes a range of styles suitable for different brand personalities:

- **Sans-serif:** Onest (default), Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Poppins, Nunito, Raleway, Montserrat, Work Sans, DM Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans, Space Grotesk, Outfit, Sora, Manrope
- **Serif:** Playfair Display, Lora, Merriweather, Source Serif 4, Crimson Text
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono, Fira Code

Select a font from the dropdown to preview it instantly in the Branding tab.

### Custom Font Name

If your brand uses a font not included in the built-in list, you can type a **custom Google Font name** directly into the font field. GritCMS will attempt to load it from Google Fonts on the public site. Make sure the font name matches exactly as it appears on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) (e.g., "Josefin Sans", not "josefin-sans").

### How Fonts Load on the Public Site

When a visitor loads your public site, GritCMS dynamically injects a Google Fonts CSS link into the HTML `<head>`:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Onest:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

The font is then applied to the body and all text elements via CSS. This approach means no font files are bundled with your site -- they are loaded from Google's CDN for optimal performance.

## Brand Color

The brand color is the primary accent color used throughout your public site for buttons, links, highlights, and interactive elements.

### Preset Colors

GritCMS offers **12 preset colors** to choose from, covering a range of common brand palettes:

- Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Lime, Green
- Emerald, Cyan, Blue, Violet, Purple, Pink

Click any preset to select it. The hex value is displayed and the preview updates instantly.

### Custom Hex Color

If none of the presets match your brand, click the **color picker** to select any color using the full hex spectrum. You can also type a hex value directly (e.g., `#4F46E5`).

### Live Preview

Below the color selection area, a **live preview** shows how your brand color looks on a sample button. This lets you evaluate the color in context before saving. The preview updates in real time as you change the selection.

### How Brand Color Applies

The brand color is stored as a CSS custom property on the public site:

```css
:root {
  --accent: #4F46E5;
}
```

All themed elements -- buttons, links, focus rings, active states, and accent backgrounds -- reference `var(--accent)` in their styles. This means changing the brand color in Settings instantly recolors every accent element across your entire public site with a single value.

## Saving and Applying Changes

After selecting your desired font and color:

1. Click **Save** at the bottom of the Branding tab.
2. The settings are persisted to the database immediately.
3. Open your public site (or refresh it) to see the changes.

There is no build step or redeployment required. The public site reads branding settings from the API on every page load, so updates are reflected instantly.

## Tips

- **Contrast matters.** When picking a brand color, make sure it has sufficient contrast against white backgrounds for readability. Dark or medium-saturated colors tend to work best for buttons and links.
- **Font consistency.** Stick to one brand font for a clean, professional look. The font applies to headings and body text alike.
- **Test on mobile.** After changing your font or color, check the public site on a mobile device to make sure everything looks good at smaller screen sizes.
- **Reset to defaults.** To go back to the default look, select "Onest" as the font and choose the blue preset color, then save.
