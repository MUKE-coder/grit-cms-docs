## Overview

Email lists are the foundation of your email marketing in GritCMS. A list is a named group of subscribers who have opted in to receive your emails. You can create multiple lists for different purposes -- for example, a general newsletter list, a product launch list, or a VIP customers list. Manage your lists from the **Email > Lists** section in the admin dashboard.

## Creating a New List

1. Navigate to **Email > Lists** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click the **New List** button.
3. Fill in the list details and save.

### List Settings

Each list has the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | A descriptive name for the list (e.g., "Weekly Newsletter"). |
| **Description** | An optional note about the list's purpose, visible only to admins. |
| **Welcome Email** | An optional email template sent automatically when someone subscribes. Select from your existing templates. |
| **Double Opt-In** | When enabled, new subscribers must confirm their email address before being added to the list. |

### Double Opt-In

When double opt-in is enabled on a list, the subscription flow works as follows:

1. A visitor submits their email address through a form or API call.
2. Their subscription status is set to **Pending** and a confirmation email is sent.
3. The subscriber clicks the confirmation link in the email.
4. Their status changes to **Active** and they begin receiving emails from the list.

Double opt-in helps ensure that subscribers genuinely want to receive your emails, reduces spam complaints, and improves deliverability. It is recommended for public-facing lists.

## Managing Subscribers

### Adding Subscribers Manually

From a list's detail page, you can add individual subscribers by clicking **Add Subscriber** and entering their email address. The subscriber is linked to a contact in your CRM -- if no matching contact exists, one is created automatically.

### Importing Subscribers

To add subscribers in bulk, use the import feature. Prepare a CSV file with at least an `email` column. Optional columns include `first_name`, `last_name`, and any other contact fields. Upload the CSV from the list detail page and GritCMS will create contacts and subscriptions for each row.

### Removing Subscribers

You can remove a subscriber from a list by changing their status to **Unsubscribed** or by deleting the subscription entirely. Unsubscribed contacts remain in your CRM but will no longer receive emails sent to that list.

### Subscription Statuses

Each subscriber on a list has one of the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | The subscriber is confirmed and will receive emails. |
| **Pending** | Awaiting double opt-in confirmation. |
| **Unsubscribed** | The subscriber opted out of the list. |
| **Bounced** | The subscriber's email address returned a bounce. |
| **Complained** | The subscriber marked an email as spam. |

### Subscription Sources

GritCMS tracks how each subscriber was added to a list. Possible sources include:

- **form** -- Subscribed through a public form on your website.
- **manual** -- Added by an admin from the dashboard.
- **import** -- Added via CSV import.
- **api** -- Added through the API.

## Public Subscription Forms

You can embed subscription forms on your website to let visitors join your lists. When a visitor submits the form, they are added to the selected list with the source recorded as `form`. If the list has double opt-in enabled, the visitor will receive a confirmation email before their subscription becomes active.

Subscription forms can be placed on any page, blog post, or funnel step using the website builder.

## Public Email Pages

GritCMS automatically provides several public-facing pages for your subscribers to manage their email preferences:

| Page | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Email Confirmation** | `yoursite.com/email/confirm/{token}` | Double opt-in confirmation page. Subscribers land here after clicking the confirmation link in the opt-in email. |
| **Unsubscribe** | `yoursite.com/email/unsubscribe` | Unsubscribe page linked from every email via the `{{unsubscribe_url}}` merge tag. |
| **Email Preferences** | `yoursite.com/email/preferences` | Subscribers can view and manage which lists they are subscribed to. |

These pages are part of the `web` app and are styled with your site's branding. No additional setup is needed -- they work automatically once email is configured.

## Tips for Organizing Your Lists

- **Keep lists focused.** Create separate lists for different topics or audiences rather than putting everyone on one giant list.
- **Use descriptive names.** "Product Launch -- Spring 2025" is more useful than "List 3."
- **Enable double opt-in for public lists.** This protects your sender reputation and ensures engaged subscribers.
- **Clean your lists periodically.** Review bounced and complained subscribers and remove contacts that are no longer valid.
- **Set a welcome email.** A welcome message sets expectations and confirms the subscription, improving engagement from the start.
