## Overview

An email sequence (also known as a drip campaign) is a series of emails sent automatically over time. When a contact is enrolled in a sequence, they receive each email at predefined intervals -- for example, a welcome email immediately, a follow-up after 1 day, and another after 3 days. Manage sequences from **Email > Sequences** in the admin dashboard.

Sequences are ideal for onboarding new subscribers, nurturing leads, delivering a multi-part course by email, or following up after a purchase.

## Creating a Sequence

1. Navigate to **Email > Sequences** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click **New Sequence**.
3. Enter the sequence name and optional description.
4. Configure the trigger settings.
5. Add your email steps with delays.

### Sequence Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | A descriptive name for the sequence (e.g., "Onboarding Series"). |
| **Description** | An optional note about what the sequence does. |
| **Trigger** | How contacts enter the sequence (manual or event-based). |
| **Trigger Event** | When the trigger is event-based, the event that starts the sequence (e.g., `email.subscribed`). |
| **Status** | The current state of the sequence: draft, active, or paused. |

## Sequence Triggers

There are two ways contacts can be enrolled in a sequence:

### Manual Enrollment

With the trigger set to **Manual**, contacts are enrolled by an admin from the dashboard or through the API. This gives you full control over who enters the sequence and when.

### Event-Based Enrollment

With the trigger set to **Event**, contacts are enrolled automatically when a specific event occurs. The most common trigger event is `email.subscribed`, which starts the sequence when someone joins an email list. This is the recommended approach for automated onboarding and nurture flows.

## Sequence Steps

Each step in a sequence represents one email that will be sent to the enrolled contact after a specified delay.

### Adding a Step

1. Open the sequence and click **Add Step**.
2. Set the **Subject** line for the email.
3. Write the **HTML Content** and **Text Content**, or select an existing template.
4. Set the **Delay** in days and hours relative to the previous step (or enrollment, for the first step).
5. Set the **Sort Order** to control the position of the step in the sequence.

### Step Timing

Delays are configured using two fields:

- **Delay Days** -- The number of days to wait before sending this step.
- **Delay Hours** -- Additional hours to add on top of the day delay.

For example, a step with a delay of 1 day and 6 hours will be sent 30 hours after the previous step. The first step's delay is measured from the time the contact is enrolled.

### Example Sequence

Here is a typical 5-step onboarding sequence:

| Step | Delay | Subject |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 days | Welcome to the community! |
| 2 | 1 day | Here's how to get started |
| 3 | 3 days | Tips to get the most out of your account |
| 4 | 7 days | Have questions? We're here to help |
| 5 | 14 days | Check out what's new |

## Sequence Status

| Status | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | The sequence is being built. No emails are sent and no new enrollments are processed. |
| **Active** | The sequence is live. Enrolled contacts receive emails on schedule, and new contacts can be enrolled. |
| **Paused** | The sequence is temporarily stopped. No emails are sent, but existing enrollments are preserved and will resume when the sequence is reactivated. |

Set a sequence to **Active** only after you have added all of your steps and tested the content.

## Enrollment Tracking

GritCMS tracks each contact's progress through a sequence with an enrollment record:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Active, completed, or cancelled. |
| **Current Step** | The step the contact is currently on. |
| **Next Send At** | The date and time the next email will be sent. |
| **Enrolled At** | When the contact entered the sequence. |
| **Completed At** | When the contact finished all steps (if applicable). |

You can cancel an individual enrollment from the sequence detail page if you need to stop a specific contact from receiving further emails.

## Best Practices

- **Start simple.** A 3 to 5 step sequence is enough for most onboarding flows. You can always add more steps later.
- **Space out your emails.** Sending too frequently can lead to unsubscribes. Give subscribers time to read each email before sending the next.
- **Write for the reader.** Each step should provide standalone value. Do not assume the reader remembers every previous email.
- **Test the full sequence.** Enroll yourself as a test contact and verify that each step arrives with the correct content and timing.
- **Monitor enrollment status.** Check for cancelled or stalled enrollments to identify issues with your sequence configuration.
