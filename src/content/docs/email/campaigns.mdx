## Overview

An email campaign is a one-time email sent to a selected audience. Use campaigns for announcements, newsletters, promotions, or any message you want to deliver to a group of subscribers. You can compose your email, choose who receives it, send it immediately, or schedule it for later. Manage campaigns from **Email > Campaigns** in the admin dashboard.

## Creating a Campaign

1. Navigate to **Email > Campaigns** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click **New Campaign**.
3. Fill in the campaign details and compose your email.
4. Select your audience and send or schedule.

### Campaign Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | An internal name for the campaign (not shown to recipients). |
| **Subject** | The email subject line your subscribers will see in their inbox. |
| **From Name** | The sender name displayed to recipients. |
| **From Email** | The sender email address. |
| **Reply-To** | The email address that receives replies. |

### Composing Your Email

You have two options for creating campaign content:

- **Use a template.** Select an existing email template from your template library. The template's HTML and text content will be loaded into the editor, and you can customize it for this campaign.
- **Write inline content.** Compose your email directly in the campaign editor using the HTML and plain text fields.

Both the HTML version and a plain text fallback are supported. The plain text version is shown to recipients whose email clients do not render HTML.

## Selecting Your Audience

Campaigns can be targeted to one or more of the following:

- **Lists** -- Send to all active subscribers on the selected email lists.
- **Segments** -- Send to contacts matching specific segment criteria.
- **Tags** -- Send to contacts with specific tags applied.

You can combine multiple lists, segments, and tags. GritCMS will deduplicate recipients so no one receives the same campaign twice.

## Sending and Scheduling

### Send Immediately

Click **Send Now** to begin delivering the campaign right away. The campaign status changes from **Draft** to **Sending** and then to **Sent** once all emails are delivered.

### Schedule for Later

To send a campaign at a specific date and time, set the **Scheduled At** field and click **Schedule**. The campaign status changes to **Scheduled** and GritCMS will begin sending at the specified time.

### Campaign Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | The campaign is being composed and has not been sent. |
| **Scheduled** | The campaign is queued to send at a future time. |
| **Sending** | The campaign is currently being delivered to recipients. |
| **Sent** | All emails have been delivered. |
| **Cancelled** | The campaign was cancelled before completion. |

## Campaign Analytics

After a campaign is sent, GritCMS tracks the following metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Sent** | Total number of emails sent. |
| **Delivered** | Emails successfully delivered to the recipient's server. |
| **Opened** | Unique recipients who opened the email. |
| **Clicked** | Unique recipients who clicked a link in the email. |
| **Bounced** | Emails that could not be delivered. |
| **Unsubscribed** | Recipients who unsubscribed after receiving the email. |

Open and click tracking is handled automatically. You can view these stats on the campaign detail page after sending.

### Individual Send Tracking

Each individual email delivery is tracked as a send record with its own status (queued, sent, delivered, opened, clicked, bounced, or failed). This lets you drill down into delivery results for specific subscribers if needed.

## Best Practices

- **Write a clear, compelling subject line.** The subject line is the first thing recipients see and determines whether they open your email.
- **Preview before sending.** Review both the HTML and plain text versions to make sure your message looks correct.
- **Segment your audience.** Sending relevant content to the right people improves open rates and reduces unsubscribes.
- **Respect unsubscribes.** Every campaign email should include an unsubscribe link. GritCMS templates include the `{{unsubscribe_url}}` variable for this purpose.
- **Test with a small list first.** Before sending to your entire audience, send a test to yourself or a small group to catch any issues.
