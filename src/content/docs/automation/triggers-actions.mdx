Workflows are powered by a combination of **triggers** (the events that start a workflow) and **actions** (the steps that execute when a workflow runs). This page covers every trigger and action available in GritCMS.

## Available Trigger Events

Trigger events are emitted by GritCMS whenever something significant happens. Each workflow listens for exactly one trigger event. When that event fires, the workflow execution begins.

### Contact Events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `contact.created` | A new contact is added to the system |
| `contact.updated` | An existing contact's details are modified |
| `contact.tagged` | A tag is added to a contact |

### Commerce Events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `order.completed` | An order is successfully completed and paid |
| `order.refunded` | An order is refunded |
| `subscription.created` | A new subscription is started |
| `subscription.cancelled` | A subscription is cancelled |

### Email Events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `subscriber.added` | A new subscriber joins a mailing list |
| `subscriber.removed` | A subscriber is removed from a list |

### Course Events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `course.enrolled` | A contact enrolls in a course |
| `course.completed` | A contact completes all lessons in a course |

### Booking Events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `appointment.booked` | A new appointment is scheduled |
| `appointment.cancelled` | An existing appointment is cancelled |

### Community Events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `community.member_joined` | A new member joins a community space |
| `community.thread_created` | A new thread is posted in a community |

The trigger event payload is passed to every action in the workflow, so actions can reference data from the event (e.g., the contact's email address or the order total).

## Available Actions

Actions are the building blocks of a workflow. After the trigger fires, actions execute in sequence from top to bottom.

### send_email

Sends an email to the contact associated with the trigger event.

- **Template** -- select an existing email template from your Email module
- **Subject Override** -- optionally override the template's subject line
- **From Name** -- optionally override the sender name

The recipient is automatically determined from the trigger event's contact data.

### add_tag

Adds a tag to the contact associated with the trigger event.

- **Tag Name** -- the tag to add (e.g., "customer", "vip", "webinar-attendee")

If the contact already has the tag, this action is silently skipped.

### remove_tag

Removes a tag from the contact associated with the trigger event.

- **Tag Name** -- the tag to remove

If the contact does not have the tag, this action is silently skipped.

### add_to_list

Adds the contact to a mailing list in the Email module.

- **List** -- select the target mailing list from a dropdown

This is useful for segmenting contacts into different email lists based on their behavior.

### webhook

Sends an HTTP POST request to an external URL with the trigger event data as the JSON body.

- **URL** -- the endpoint to call (must be HTTPS)
- **Headers** -- optional custom headers (e.g., an authorization token)

Use this to integrate with external services like Slack, Zapier, or your own APIs.

### delay

Pauses the workflow execution for a specified duration before continuing to the next action.

- **Duration** -- the amount of time to wait
- **Unit** -- minutes, hours, or days

This is useful for spacing out actions, such as sending a follow-up email 24 hours after a purchase.

## Chaining Multiple Actions

A single workflow can contain as many actions as you need. Actions execute in the order they appear. For example, a "New Customer" workflow might chain these actions:

1. **add_tag** -- tag the contact as "customer"
2. **add_to_list** -- add them to the "Customers" mailing list
3. **send_email** -- send a thank-you email immediately
4. **delay** -- wait 3 days
5. **send_email** -- send a feedback request email

You can reorder actions by dragging them in the workflow editor. Adding a new action places it at the end by default.

## Conditional Logic

GritCMS workflows support basic conditional logic through the trigger event data. When configuring an action, you can set **conditions** that must be true for the action to execute:

- **Field** -- a property from the trigger event payload (e.g., `order.total`, `contact.country`)
- **Operator** -- equals, not equals, greater than, less than, contains
- **Value** -- the value to compare against

If the condition is not met, the action is skipped and the workflow continues to the next action. This allows you to build branching logic within a single workflow -- for example, only sending a VIP welcome email if the order total exceeds a certain amount.

## Tips

- Start with simple workflows (one trigger, one or two actions) and add complexity as needed.
- Use the **delay** action to avoid overwhelming contacts with too many messages at once.
- Test workflows in **draft** status by manually triggering events before setting them to **active**.
- Monitor the execution history regularly to catch and fix any failed actions.
