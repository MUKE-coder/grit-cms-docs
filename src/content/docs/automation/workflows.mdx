Workflows are GritCMS's built-in automation engine. They let you define event-driven sequences that run automatically when something happens in your system -- a new contact signs up, an order is completed, a course enrollment occurs, and more. Instead of manually sending emails or tagging contacts, workflows handle it for you.

## How Workflows Work

A workflow consists of three parts:

1. **Trigger** -- the event that starts the workflow (e.g., `contact.created`)
2. **Actions** -- the steps that execute in order (e.g., send an email, add a tag)
3. **Status** -- whether the workflow is actively listening for its trigger

When the trigger event fires, GritCMS creates a **workflow execution** that processes each action sequentially. Every execution is logged so you can review what happened and troubleshoot if needed.

## Creating a Workflow

Navigate to **Automation > Workflows** in the admin panel and click **New Workflow**. You will be asked to fill in:

- **Name** -- a descriptive label for the workflow (e.g., "Welcome New Subscribers")
- **Description** -- an optional summary of what the workflow does
- **Trigger Event** -- the event that activates the workflow (selected from a dropdown of available events)
- **Status** -- the initial state of the workflow

Once created, you can add actions to the workflow from the workflow detail page. Actions execute in the order they are listed and can be reordered by dragging.

## Workflow Status

Every workflow has one of three statuses:

### Draft

The workflow is being built and will **not** execute, even if the trigger event fires. Use this while you are still adding or testing actions.

### Active

The workflow is live. When its trigger event fires, a new execution is created and all actions run in sequence. Only activate a workflow when you are confident it is configured correctly.

### Paused

The workflow was previously active but has been temporarily stopped. No new executions are created while paused. Existing in-progress executions will finish, but no new ones will start. Use this to temporarily disable a workflow without deleting it.

You can change the status at any time from the workflow list or detail page.

## Execution History and Logs

Every time a workflow runs, GritCMS creates an **execution record** with the following details:

- **Execution ID** -- a unique identifier
- **Status** -- `running`, `completed`, or `failed`
- **Started At / Completed At** -- timestamps for the execution
- **Trigger Data** -- the event payload that started the execution
- **Action Results** -- the outcome of each action in the sequence

Navigate to a workflow's detail page and click the **Executions** tab to see its full history. If an action fails, the execution is marked as `failed` and the error message is recorded in the logs. This makes it straightforward to identify and fix problems.

## Example Workflows

Here are common workflows to get you started:

### Welcome Email on Signup

- **Trigger:** `contact.created`
- **Actions:** Send a welcome email using your "Welcome" email template

This sends every new contact an introductory email as soon as they are added to your system.

### Tag Contact on Purchase

- **Trigger:** `order.completed`
- **Actions:** Add the tag "customer" to the contact associated with the order

This automatically labels anyone who completes a purchase, making it easy to segment customers from leads in your contact list.

### Notify on New Order

- **Trigger:** `order.completed`
- **Actions:** Send a webhook notification to your Slack or Discord channel with the order details

This keeps your team informed in real time whenever a sale comes through, without needing to check the admin panel.

### Enroll in Follow-Up Sequence

- **Trigger:** `course.enrolled`
- **Actions:** Add the contact to your "Course Students" list, then send a "Getting Started" email after a 1-hour delay

This ensures new students receive onboarding materials automatically after enrolling in a course.
