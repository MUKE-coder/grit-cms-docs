## Overview

Every funnel is made up of one or more steps. Each step is a single page that your visitor sees as they move through the funnel. Steps are displayed in the order you define, and you can add, edit, remove, or rearrange them at any time from the funnel editor in the admin dashboard.

## Adding Steps to a Funnel

1. Open the funnel you want to edit from **Funnels** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click **Add Step**.
3. Fill in the step details and save.

New steps are automatically placed at the end of the funnel. GritCMS assigns the next available `sort_order` value so the new step appears after all existing steps.

## Step Types

Each step has a type that describes its role in the funnel. The available step types are:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Landing** | The entry point of the funnel. This is the first page visitors see. Use it for headlines, hero sections, and calls to action. |
| **Sales** | A long-form sales page designed to persuade visitors to buy. Ideal for product descriptions, testimonials, and feature breakdowns. |
| **Checkout** | The purchase page where visitors enter payment details and complete a transaction. |
| **Upsell** | An optional page shown after checkout that offers a related or upgraded product. |
| **Downsell** | A follow-up offer shown if the visitor declines the upsell, typically at a lower price point. |
| **Thank You** | The final confirmation page. Use it to thank the visitor, provide download links, or suggest next steps. |

You can use any combination of step types in a funnel. There is no requirement to include every type.

## Step Settings

When creating or editing a step, you configure the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The display name for the step, shown in the admin funnel editor (e.g., "Main Sales Page"). |
| **Slug** | A URL-friendly identifier for the step. The full public URL for the step is `/funnels/{funnel-slug}/{step-slug}`. Auto-generated from the name if left blank. |
| **Type** | One of `landing`, `sales`, `checkout`, `upsell`, `downsell`, or `thankyou`. |
| **Sort Order** | A numeric value that determines the step's position in the funnel. Lower numbers appear first. |
| **Settings** | A JSON object for additional configuration such as button text, redirect URLs, or custom behavior. |

## Step Content Editor

Each step has a rich content editor where you build the page that visitors will see. The content is stored as structured JSON, which means you can create layouts with headings, text blocks, images, buttons, and embedded forms. The editor provides a visual interface for composing your page without writing code.

For advanced use cases, you can edit the content JSON directly to add custom elements or integrate with external tools.

## Reordering Steps

To change the order of steps in your funnel:

1. Open the funnel editor.
2. Drag and drop the steps into the desired order, or use the **Reorder** action.
3. Save the new order.

Behind the scenes, reordering sends a list of step IDs in the new order to the API. The `sort_order` field on each step is updated accordingly. Visitors who access the funnel will see the steps in the updated sequence.
