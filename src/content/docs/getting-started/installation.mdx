## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

| Tool | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Go** | 1.21+ | Backend API server |
| **Node.js** | 18+ | Frontend applications |
| **pnpm** | 10+ | Package manager for the monorepo |
| **Docker** (optional) | 20+ | PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, MailHog |
| **Air** (optional) | latest | Go live-reload for development |

If you have Docker installed, you do not need to install PostgreSQL, Redis, or MinIO separately -- the included `docker-compose.yml` handles everything.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MUKE-coder/gritcms.git
cd gritcms
```

## Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies

From the monorepo root, install all JavaScript dependencies for the admin, web, and shared packages:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This uses pnpm workspaces to install dependencies for all three apps and the shared types package in a single command.

## Step 3: Start Infrastructure Services

Use Docker Compose to spin up PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO (file storage), and MailHog (email testing):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts the following services:

| Service | Port | Credentials |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | 5432 | `grit` / `grit` / db: `gritcms` |
| **Redis** | 6379 | No auth |
| **MinIO** (S3 storage) | 9000 (API), 9001 (Console) | `minioadmin` / `minioadmin` |
| **MailHog** (email) | 1025 (SMTP), 8025 (UI) | None |

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The defaults work out of the box with the Docker Compose services. The key variables to verify:

```env
APP_PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=postgres://grit:grit@localhost:5432/gritcms?sslmode=disable
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
STORAGE_DRIVER=minio
JWT_SECRET=change-me-in-production
```

See the [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment) reference for the full list.

## Step 5: Start the Backend API

Navigate to the API directory and start the Go server:

```bash
cd apps/api && go run ./cmd/server
```

Or, if you have [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) installed for live-reload:

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

The API server starts on **port 8080** by default. You will see output confirming database connection, Redis, storage, and available dashboards:

```
Server starting on port 8080
GORM Studio available at http://localhost:8080/studio
API Documentation at http://localhost:8080/docs
```

GORM auto-migrates all tables on startup -- no manual migration step is needed.

## Step 6: Start the Admin Dashboard

In a new terminal, from the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter admin dev
```

The admin dashboard starts on **http://localhost:3000**. This is where you manage all content, products, contacts, and settings.

## Step 7: Start the Public Website

In another terminal, from the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter web dev
```

The public website starts on **http://localhost:3001**. This is the visitor-facing frontend that renders your pages, blog, courses, and storefront.

## All-in-One Development

You can also start all three frontend services simultaneously using Turborepo:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs the admin and web dev servers in parallel. You still need to start the Go API separately (Step 5).

## Verify the Setup

Once all services are running, verify everything is working:

| URL | What to expect |
|-----|----------------|
| `http://localhost:8080/docs` | API documentation page |
| `http://localhost:8080/studio` | GORM Studio database browser |
| `http://localhost:3000` | Admin dashboard (login/setup page) |
| `http://localhost:3001` | Public website |
| `http://localhost:8025` | MailHog email testing UI |
| `http://localhost:9001` | MinIO console (file storage) |

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

If port 8080, 3000, or 3001 is already taken, change the port in your `.env` file (`APP_PORT`) or in the respective `next.config` files for the frontend apps.

### Database connection refused

Make sure the Docker containers are running: `docker compose ps`. If PostgreSQL is not healthy, check logs with `docker compose logs postgres`.

### pnpm install fails

Ensure you are using pnpm 10 or later. Check your version with `pnpm --version`. If you need to upgrade: `npm install -g pnpm@latest`.

### Go module download errors

Run `go mod download` inside the `apps/api` directory to pre-fetch all Go dependencies. If you are behind a proxy, set `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct`.

### Redis connection warning

Redis is optional for development. If Redis is not running, the API will log a warning and disable caching and background jobs. Everything else works normally.

### MinIO bucket not found

On first startup, you may need to create the upload bucket manually via the MinIO Console at `http://localhost:9001`. Create a bucket named `gritcms-uploads` (or whatever `MINIO_BUCKET` is set to in your `.env`).
