## First-Time Setup

When you visit the admin dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` for the first time, GritCMS walks you through an initial setup wizard. This only runs once and configures the essentials for your site.

### Create Your Admin Account

The first screen asks you to create the administrator account. Enter your name, email, and a strong password. This account has full access to every module and setting in the system.

### Configure Site Settings

Next, configure the basic identity of your site:

- **Site Name** -- the name displayed in the header, browser tab, and emails (e.g., "My Creator Hub")
- **Tagline** -- a short description shown on your homepage and in meta tags
- **Logo** -- upload your brand logo (displayed in the admin sidebar and public site header)

These settings can be changed later from **Settings > General** in the admin dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

After setup, you land on the **admin dashboard**. This is your command center with quick access to every module.

### Key Sections in the Sidebar

| Section | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Overview metrics, recent activity, quick actions |
| **Pages** | Create and manage website pages |
| **Blog** | Write and publish blog posts |
| **Email** | Manage lists, subscribers, and campaigns |
| **Courses** | Build and sell online courses |

### Command Search

Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on macOS) anywhere in the admin to open the **command search**. This lets you quickly jump to any page, create new content, or search across your entire dashboard without navigating through menus.

## Quick Action: Create a Page

1. Navigate to **Pages** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Page**.
3. Enter a title (the slug is auto-generated from the title).
4. Use the block editor to add content -- text, images, buttons, and embeds.
5. Click **Publish** to make the page live on your public website.

Your page is immediately visible at `http://localhost:3001/pages/your-page-slug`.

## Quick Action: Write a Blog Post

1. Navigate to **Blog** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Post**.
3. Fill in the title, excerpt, and featured image.
4. Write your content using the rich text editor.
5. Assign categories and tags for organization.
6. Click **Publish** to make it live.

Published posts appear on your public blog at `http://localhost:3001/blog`.

## Quick Action: Create a Course

1. Navigate to **Courses** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Course**.
3. Enter the course title, description, thumbnail, and pricing.
4. Add **modules** to organize your content into sections.
5. Inside each module, add **lessons** with text, video, or downloadable content.
6. Toggle the course to **Published** when ready.

Students can browse and enroll in courses on your public site. Track enrollment and progress from the admin.

## Quick Action: Set Up Email Marketing

1. Navigate to **Email** in the sidebar.
2. Create a new **List** (e.g., "Newsletter Subscribers").
3. Add subscribers manually or let them sign up through your public website.
4. Create a **Campaign** to send a broadcast email to your list.
5. Track opens, clicks, and unsubscribes from the campaign analytics view.

Make sure your [email/SMTP settings](/configuration/email-smtp) are configured before sending.

## Quick Action: Add a Product

1. Navigate to **Products** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Product**.
3. Set the product name, description, images, and price.
4. Choose the product type: digital download, physical product, or subscription.
5. Optionally create **coupons** for discounts.
6. Publish the product to your storefront.
